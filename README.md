# README

This repo is a demonstration of using Capta for data journalism.
It should have files in formats like md, csv, vgl, sql, svg, png, and jpg.

Let's start with a fake [dataset](people.csv) we generated at [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).
It's easy to show the CSV file in a table. Using this code:

````
```csv ./people.csv
```
````

will get you this table:

```csv ./people.csv
```
